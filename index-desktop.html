            <p><b>FILLER CONTENT </b> While studying abroad, Tim had the opportunity to participate in conversation exchange tables where he could practice speaking Japanese with native Japanese students and community members. Upon returning to the United States, he decided to start KaiwaLounge, a language exchange program modeled after his experience abroad. Thinking that in-person programs were rather inconvenient, he decided to make KaiwaLounge an online program. Two weeks later, COVID-19 shut down all in-person classes and in-person language exchange programs. Coincidence?</p>
            <p>In the early days, Tim matched people learning Japanese with people learning English one-by-one on a Google Spreadsheet. Now, with the help of an amazing all-remote team, KaiwaLounge has upgraded many of its processes. We still match people on spreadsheets though - some things never change.</p>
            <p>Today, Kaiwalounge has grown to over 70 participants from institutions around the world, including the University of California, Middlebury College, International Christian University, and Hosei University. Although we're growing at a rapid pace, our priority is always to provide the best experience possible for our participants.</p>
