      <p className="ml-5 mr-5">BearsBlog is a website that shares self-improvement articles by Cal students. We aim to help fellow Bears better navigate and enjoy their Berkeley experience, all while improving their lifestyle, character, and skill.</p>
      <p className="ml-5 mr-5 font-weight-bold">GO GOLDEN BEARS!!!</p>
      <div className="attention-catcher-body-about font-italic ml-5 mt-5"><p>Who is behind BearsBlog?</p></div>
      <p className="ml-5 mr-5">BearsBlog strives to represent all voices within Berkeley. We publish submissions by Cal Bears, for Cal Bears! The admins managing this page are Chancellor Carol Christ's special unit, the conspirators of whom will remain anonymous for national security.</p>
      <div className="attention-catcher-body-about font-italic ml-5 mt-5"><p>How can I submit to BearsBlog?</p></div>
      <p className="ml-5 mr-5">Feel free to email bblog@berkeley.edu with your article and name! Do keep in mind though, that we only post submissions once every 240 days, if that day falls on a full moon night. We also screen all submissions for all anti-Carol Christ propaganda.</p>
      <div className="attention-catcher-body-about font-italic ml-5 mt-5"><p>Can I work for BearsBlog?</p></div>
      <p className="ml-5 mr-5">Yeah! Applications for an intern position will open this Saturday, and a two-year long training program will begin upon acceptance. You will get to post your first article once you have completed this training and passed all of our test with flying colors!</p>
      <div className="attention-catcher-body-about font-italic ml-5 mt-5"><p>More questions?</p></div>
      <p className="ml-5 mr-5">We'll be under the Campanile every 420 days, every half-moon night! Come find us there anytime :-)</p>
