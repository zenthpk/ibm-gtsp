Alright everyone. So today we’ll talk about the Pythagorean theorem. And Pythagorean theorem is basically concerned with right triangles so a triangle that has a right angle. We’ll label the shortest side with a the next side with b and the hypotenuse with c. And the pythagorean’s theorem tells us that a squared plus b squared is equal to c squared. So for any right triangle the square of these two sides here will always equal the square of the hypotenuse, which is pretty cool. So if we test this out with an example, let’s say a is equal to 3 b is equal to 4 and c is equal to 5. We’ll see that this equation holds true. So let’s try it out. So we’ve got 3 squared plus 4 squared is equal to 5 squared. And we’ll find out if that’s true by saying 9 plus 16 is equal to 25. And yep everything matches up so we are good to go.
